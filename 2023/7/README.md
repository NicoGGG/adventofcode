I tried again to do Object Oriented after the disappointment of day 2.

This puzzle seemed a lot more suited to it, and I was able to get a working solution in a reasonable amount of time.

Faithful to OOP spirit, it's a bit over-engineered, but the code is very readable in exchange.

The set_type() method, where the type of the hand is determined is a bit long and very if-y (especially in part 2).
There is probably a more elegant way to do it, but again the code seems more readable as a tradeoff, because the code is doing quite literally what the problem says.
